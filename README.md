This is a mold made to cast the hand of a humanoid robot. The mold will be 3D printed, so it is segmented to three parts to avoid errors in printing. 
These parts have irregular shapes to help in mold assembly, and also have keys to align parts perfectly.
The casting material is silicone rubber, so, thermal analysis of the casting process is disregarded, as silicone is casted at room temperature.

[Here](/STL\files) in this git, separate STL files of molds for left and right hands.

The video below shows the assembly process, with keys of the mold are indicated with red circles. It only shows animation of the left hand.
